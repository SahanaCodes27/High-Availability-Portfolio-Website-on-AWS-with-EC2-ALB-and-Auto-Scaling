# High-Availability-Portfolio-Website-on-AWS-with-EC2-ALB-and-Auto-Scaling
High availability portfolio website deployed on AWS with EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, and VPC — showcasing cloud architecture, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## 📌 Overview  
Deployed a **scalable portfolio website** on AWS using:  
- **EC2** for hosting  
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for traffic distribution  
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** for elasticity and fault tolerance  
- **VPC networking** with subnets, security groups, and routing  
 
This project demonstrates **high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance** in a real-world AWS architecture.
